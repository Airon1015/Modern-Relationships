			Our world is advancing rapidly even compared to the explosive growth after the devastating WW2.
			The new generation, nicknamed "tech natives", are developing in a whole new world than anyone
			can truly prepare them for. Meanwhile, the older generations have a hard time catching up in this
			brave new world. Therefore it begs the question, how good are these changes?. In this page I will
			summarize the results I have found into short concise answers so that young and old alike can easily
			read and comprehend my content.
		</p>
		<br>
			I will ask for the future readers to continue where I left off and read more about this topic as no
			one perspective can truly encapsulate a topic as large as this. I will be leaving my sources at the 
			bottom of the page for where I got my thoughts. Now off you go to scroll down and read :>.

			It grants easy communication to people all around the world allowing for
			Long-Distance Friendships to occur, unlikely friends to meet, and most importantly
			to contact friends to talk/hangout!
		<br>
		<br>
			It allows for multiple conversations to happen. This is most commonly seen with
			messaging centered apps like messenger. This is a great addition as it allows for efficient
			use of time. In work, family, or friendships.

			It allows for people to reach out to the world for help. In can be in the form of a google search
			to search for how to do a task, A reddit post to ask for advice, or a blog to spread awareness of
			a personal emergency. All of this allows people, often strangers, to see their plight and help them
			solve it.

			The disconnect allows people to easily express their thoughts and emotions to their
			friends or to the world. ICT also allows them to express it in pictures and video, things
			not easily done otherwise.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div  id="Apic">

			The disconnect also allows shy people to open up. This is sometimes the only way people
			can be "eased" in to social life. A much better alternative to "Go out and make friends".

			People can grow reliant on the detachedness of technology leading to underdeveloped
			face to face social skills. This is currently a very real and widespread problem.

			ICT may give you easy access to the people you cherish in life but it also gives easy access to
			the people you want to keep away from to you. Cyberbullying is a very real thing as well as a 
			plethora of insults by the online community if you manage to gain the ire of a crowd.

			Isolation, a state that could be further amplified by ICT, after all whats worse than
			feeling lonely despite being surrounded by friends, online or face to face.
		<br>

			Vanity, a sin that is being fed by ICT. One can spend hours just to get the picture just
			right or to get a post just right to feed their ego. On the other side however, it could also
			pressure people in putting up a front to hide what they feel or think as they won't want to be
			left behind.

			Access to too much information, We all know that a lot of people have seen their first look of
			another person's... for a lack of a better term <b>uncovered</b> body or other inappropriate subjects
			in this internet world.

			Do you know the saying where one shows his true self when no one is looking? The Anonimity of the internet
			allows people to freely express their true selves without repercussion, the good <b>AND</b> the bad

	<div id="Alabel"> Conclusion</div>
	<div id="Atext">
		<p>
		ICT has many good and bad effects. Many studies will agree with me that its for the better but
		not without its risks. It's easily one of the best tools one person can have. It is an amplifier
		of anything and everything that you focus on while using it. It can help you connect with others,
		better yourself, and stand up for your values when you use it right but it can be easily be
		excessive and sometimes addictive, the fame , the pressure, the physical isolation of it all could
		easily be your worst enemy. Just be true to yourself, stand with your friends, always do whats
		right, and ICT will do the rest.

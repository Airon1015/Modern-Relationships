<h1>ICT... What about it?</h1>

<p>
	According to all known laws
	of aviation,  
	there is no way a bee
	should be able to fly.  
	Its wings are too small to get
	its fat little body off the ground.  
	The bee, of course, flies anyway  
	because bees don't care
	what humans think is impossible.  
	Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
	Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  
	Ooh, black and yellow!
	Let's shake it up a little.  
	Barry! Breakfast is ready!  
	Ooming!  
	Hang on a second.  
	Hello?  
	- Barry?
	- Adam?
	- Oan you believe this is happening?
	- I can't. I'll pick you up.
	Looking sharp.
	Use the stairs. Your father
	paid good money for those.
	Sorry. I'm excited.
	Here's the graduate.
	We're very proud of you, son.
	A perfect report card, all B's.
	Very proud. 
	Ma! I got a thing going here.  
	- You got lint on your fuzz.
	- Ow! That's me! 
	- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
	- Bye!
